# Artificial Intelligence & NLP Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python-based implementations focusing on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. The project covers the full pipeline from raw text processing to predictive modeling using structured data.

---

## 📂 Repository Roadmap

The repository is organized into three main functional areas:

### 1. NLP Fundamentals (`/nltk_nlp_activity`)
This module explores the core linguistics tasks required to prepare text for AI models.
* **`tokenization.py`**: Splitting strings into meaningful units (words/sentences).
* **`pos_based_lemmatization.py`**: Using Part-of-Speech tags to accurately reduce words to their dictionary root.
* **`ner_exploration.py`**: Extracting Named Entities like names, organizations, and locations.
* **`topic_words.py`**: Identifying the most significant words within a text corpus.
* **`sentiment.py`**: A foundation for rule-based sentiment detection.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis (`/sentiment-analysis-nltk`)
A specialized project focused on determining the emotional tone of a text.
* **`sentiment_analysis.py`**: Uses the NLTK library to classify text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

### 3. Disease Prediction (`/ml-disease-prediction`)
Applying classification algorithms to medical data to predict health outcomes based on symptoms.



* **`decision_tree.py`**: A logic-based approach that splits data into branches to reach a diagnosis.
* **`naive_bayes.py`**: A statistical approach that calculates the probability of a disease based on prior evidence.
